# GoPro-Import

## Synopsis

Importing of GoPro media files to your local machine made easy.

## Code Example

Simply run the following command in the command line:

```cmd
python copy_from_cam.py <PATH_TO_YOUR_GOPRO> <DESTINATION_PATH> --log=INFO
```

## Motivation

Sick of importing files with Quik? Do you often copy your files to your local machine only temporarily in order to move them to another place soon after (e.g. your network share)?
Standard import solutions do not remember which files have been copied and which ones weren't. So you don't have to import every file again and again
if you haven't cleaned the sd card of your cam in the meantime.

GoPro-Import helps you with that. It remembers which files were copied and does the copying job for your. Automatically and quickly.

## Installation

Simply clone the repo and run the command from above.
